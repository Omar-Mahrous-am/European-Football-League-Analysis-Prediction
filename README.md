# ⚽ European Football League Analysis & Prediction

This project explores and analyzes data from five major European football leagues to uncover insights, visualize distributions, and build a basic prediction model for future team positions.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

This analysis covers key aspects of football team performance over multiple seasons. The goal is to identify correlations between different variables and use machine learning to predict future rankings.

### 🔍 Main Tasks:

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Correlation Matrix & Visualization
- One-Hot Encoding of Categorical Features
- Linear Regression Model
- Model Evaluation Function
- Predictive Insights for Future Seasons

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains historical performance data for teams from five major European football leagues.

- File: `5_leages_data.csv`
- Columns include season information, team statistics, league name, and more.

---

## 📈 Example Visuals

- Correlation heatmaps
- Distribution plots for goals, points, and other performance metrics

---

## 🧠 Model

A simple **Linear Regression** model was trained after applying one-hot encoding. A custom function was created to evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as:

- R² Score
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Predictions were made to estimate future season positions for selected teams.
