2. Choose your team
3. Click "PREDICT NEXT SEASON POINTS"
4. View the AI-powered prediction with detailed analysis

## Model
- **Algorithm:** Linear Regression
- **Features:** Historical wins, draws, losses, goals for/against
- **Data:** 20+ years of European football data

## üìä Project Overview

This analysis covers key aspects of football team performance over multiple seasons. The goal is to identify correlations between different variables and use machine learning to predict future rankings.

### üîç Main Tasks:

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Correlation Matrix & Visualization
- One-Hot Encoding of Categorical Features
- Linear Regression Model
- Model Evaluation Function
- Predictive Insights for Future Seasons

## üß∞ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**

---

## üìÅ Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains historical performance data for teams from five major European football leagues.

- File: `5_leages_data.csv`
- Columns include season information, team statistics, league name, and more.

---

## üìà Example Visuals

- Correlation heatmaps
- Distribution plots for goals, points, and other performance metrics

---

## üß† Model

A simple **Linear Regression** model was trained after applying one-hot encoding. A custom function was created to evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as:

- R¬≤ Score
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Predictions were made to estimate future season positions for selected teams.
